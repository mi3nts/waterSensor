#Instructions:

##(Initial Setup)

-   Step 3: Remove black plug(its the small black attachement with a cylindrical hole) from the top of the manta sensor 
    (opposite end from where the calibration cup was attached).
-   Step 4: Plug underwater cable into the now exposed top connecter: first pull the shield back, next plug the cable in and make sure
    the pins are lined up, then twist the shield into place (it has a screw-lock mechanism).
-   Step 5: Next, locate the female to male usb cable and plug it into the usb to serial adapter.
-   Step 6: Now, connect the serial adapter to the underwater cable.
-   Step 7: Connect to the PC.
-   Step 8: If this is the first time you are connecting the sensor to the PC, then make sure the sensor shows up in one of the COM ports     as "Prolific USB-to-Serial COM Port".
-   Step 9: Launch the Manta2 control software that was installed in Step 1. Turn manta data logging on and you should see values start to     populate the table.
